## General Guidelines for All Subagents

### Development Standards
- Follow Storyline's voice-first philosophy in all implementations
- Prioritize emotional safety and trauma-informed design
- Maintain <200ms latency for real-time features where applicable
- Implement comprehensive testing for specialized functionality
- Ensure privacy compliance for sensitive user data
- Document all specialized implementations thoroughly

### Testing Requirements
- Create specific test suites for your domain expertise
- Validate performance against Storyline's quality standards
- Test edge cases and error conditions thoroughly
- Include accessibility testing where applicable
- Validate cultural sensitivity and inclusivity

### Coordination & Collaboration Protocol

**MANDATORY: Before starting any development work, all agents must:**

1. **Read Required Documentation**
   - Check `/CLAUDE.md` for current project context and guidelines
   - Review `/docs/project-management/subagent-coordination-plan.md` for coordination protocols
   - Reference `/docs/project-management/subagent-pre-work-checklist.md` for quality gates
   - Check `/docs/project-management/to-do.md` for related tasks and dependencies

2. **Complete Pre-Work Checklist**
   - **Voice-First Philosophy Check:** Does this feature prioritize voice interaction? Is the voice interface intuitive and accessible? Does it maintain voice persona consistency?
   - **Emotional Safety Assessment:** Have I considered trauma-informed design implications? Does this feature respect user boundaries? Is crisis detection/response appropriate? Are privacy protections adequate for sensitive content?
   - **Performance Validation:** Will this maintain required latency standards? Have I planned for performance testing? Are there optimization opportunities?
   - **Cross-Domain Coordination:** Have I checked for dependencies on other agents? Are integration points documented? Do other domains need notification of changes?
   - **Testing & Documentation:** Is specialized testing planned for my domain? Are documentation updates identified? Is accessibility testing included where relevant?

3. **Cross-Agent Coordination Check**
   - Search to-do list for related tasks using tags: `[DEPENDS: agent-name]`, `[BLOCKS: agent-name]`, `[INTEGRATES: agent-name]`
   - Identify any blocking or prerequisite work from other agents
   - Document integration points and dependencies in to-do list
   - Note any potential conflicts or overlapping functionality

4. **Task Documentation Protocol**
   When updating the to-do list, use this format:
   ```
   ## Task: [Task Name]
   **Status:** [pending/in_progress/completed/blocked]
   **Assigned Agent:** [your-agent-name]
   **Dependencies:** [DEPENDS: agent-name] [BLOCKS: agent-name]
   **Integration Points:** [INTEGRATES: agent-name]
   **Quality Gates:** [checklist-completed/design-reviewed/implementation-reviewed]
   **Documentation Updates:** [list of docs to update]
   **Cross-Domain Notes:** [coordination notes and decisions]
   ```

### Quality Gates & Validation

**All agents must validate against these standards:**

- **Performance Standards:**
  - Voice processing: <200ms latency, >95% accuracy
  - Memory queries: <100ms response time
  - Real-time features: Maintain responsiveness under load

- **Emotional Safety Standards:**
  - 100% crisis detection validation for user-facing features
  - Trauma-informed design principles followed
  - User consent and boundary mechanisms implemented
  - Privacy protections meet HIPAA-level standards

- **Integration Standards:**
  - Cross-domain dependencies documented and coordinated
  - Consistent with overall Storyline architecture
  - Voice-first philosophy maintained across all features
  - Cultural sensitivity validated for user-facing content

### Communication & Documentation

- **Task Updates:** Update to-do list progress and coordination notes regularly
- **Cross-Domain Decisions:** Document decisions that affect other agents in "Coordination Notes"
- **Blocking Issues:** Escalate with clear problem description and suggested resolution
- **Integration Requirements:** Document specific requirements for other agents
- **Knowledge Sharing:** Document lessons learned and best practices for future reference
- **Documentation Maintenance:** Update relevant `/docs/` files as part of task completion

### Escalation Protocol

**When to escalate coordination issues:**
- Conflicting implementations between agents
- Unclear cross-domain dependencies
- Performance standard conflicts
- Integration point disagreements
- Documentation inconsistencies

**How to escalate:**
- Update to-do list with clear problem description
- Tag relevant agents in coordination notes
- Propose specific solutions or alternatives
- Request coordination meeting if needed
