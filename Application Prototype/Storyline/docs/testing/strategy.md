### 4.3 Chaos Engineering for AI System Resilience

**Objective**: To ensure the Storyline backend remains stable, responsive, and fails gracefully when its dependencies (AI services, databases) are unavailable or degraded.

**Methodology**: We will integrate Chaos Engineering principles into our CI/CD pipeline for the staging environment. This involves intentionally injecting failures into the system to identify and fix weaknesses before they impact users.

**Tools**:
- **toxiproxy**: A TCP proxy to simulate network and system failures.
- **Custom Scripts**: For application-level fault injection.

**Test Scenarios**:

```yaml
Chaos Test Suite:
  - name: "AI Provider Latency"
    type: "network_latency"
    service_target: "ai-orchestrator"
    dependency: "OpenAI API"
    parameters:
      latency_ms: 2000
      jitter_ms: 500
    expected_outcome: "The service should timeout gracefully and attempt a fallback to a secondary provider (e.g., Claude)."

  - name: "Database Connection Failure"
    type: "connection_failure"
    service_target: "memory"
    dependency: "Chroma DB"
    expected_outcome: "The memory service should return a 503 Service Unavailable error, and the ai-orchestrator should proceed with a conversation without retrieved context."

  - name: "High Error Rate from TTS Service"
    type: "api_error_rate"
    service_target: "ai-orchestrator"
    dependency: "Deepgram API"
    parameters:
      error_rate: 0.5 # 50% of requests fail
      error_code: 500
    expected_outcome: "The service should detect the high error rate, mark the provider as unhealthy, and switch to a fallback TTS provider."
```

**Implementation**: A new, dedicated testing job will be added to the staging deployment pipeline. This job will run the chaos test suite after the application has been successfully deployed. If any of the chaos tests fail (i.e., the system does not respond as expected), the pipeline will fail, preventing a promotion to production.

**Response Protocol Validation**
```javascript
// Crisis Response Test Scenarios
const crisisTestScenarios = [
  {
    type: 'suicidal_ideation',
    triggers: ['want to end it all', 'life not worth living'],
    expected_response: 'immediate_crisis_protocol',
    escalation: 'emergency_contacts_notification'
  },
  {
    type: 'severe_depression',
    triggers: ['hopeless', 'nothing matters', 'can\'t go on'],
    expected_response: 'supportive_resources',
    escalation: 'mental_health_professional_recommendation'
  }
];
```
