## 1. Executive Summary

Storyline handles uniquely sensitive data: intimate personal memories, traumatic experiences, and emotional processing through AI conversation. This specification establishes comprehensive privacy and security measures that go beyond standard compliance to create emotional safety for vulnerable storytelling.

**Core Principles:**
- **Emotional Consent First**: Users maintain granular control over what AI remembers and processes
- **Privacy by Design**: Every feature designed with privacy as a foundational requirement
- **Trauma-Informed Security**: Recognition that data breaches involving personal memories cause deeper harm
- **Transparent Control**: Users understand and control every aspect of their data journey

## 2. GDPR/CCPA Compliance Framework

### 2.1 Legal Basis Under GDPR

**Primary Legal Basis: Article 6(1)(a) - Consent**
- Explicit, informed consent for processing personal memoir content
- Granular consent for different processing purposes:
  - ✅ Voice transcription and storage
  - ✅ AI conversation and memory formation  
  - ✅ Writing assistance and content generation
  - ✅ Cloud synchronization and backup
  - ✅ Analytics for service improvement (anonymized)

**Special Category Data (Article 9):**
- Memoir content often reveals health information, religious beliefs, sexual orientation
- **Article 9(2)(a)**: Explicit consent required with additional safeguards
- **Right to withdraw**: Immediate processing cessation upon consent withdrawal

### 2.2 Data Subject Rights Implementation

| Right | Implementation | Response Time |
|-------|---------------|---------------|

| **Erasure (Art. 17)** | Selective memory deletion, project termination, account deletion | 72 hours |
| **Portability (Art. 20)** | Export in JSON, PDF, DOCX, MP3 formats | 30 days |
| **Restriction (Art. 18)** | Pause AI processing while maintaining data integrity | Immediate |
| **Objection (Art. 21)** | Opt-out of specific processing activities | Immediate |

### 2.3 CCPA Compliance

**Consumer Rights Under CCPA:**
- **Right to Know**: Detailed privacy policy explaining memoir data collection
- **Right to Delete**: Complete data deletion including backups and derived content
- **Right to Opt-Out**: No selling of personal information (N/A - we don't sell data)
- **Right to Non-Discrimination**: Same service quality regardless of privacy choices

**CCPA Categories of Personal Information:**
- **Category A**: Identifiers (email, user ID)
- **Category F**: Audio recordings and transcriptions
- **Category H**: Sensory data (voice patterns, emotional tone)
- **Category K**: Inferences (writing style, emotional patterns, narrative preferences)

## 3. Emotional Consent Models for Traumatic Content

### 3.1 Trauma-Informed Consent Framework

**Pre-Processing Consent Layers:**

```
Level 1: General Memoir Writing
├── Voice recording and transcription
├── Basic writing assistance
└── Chapter organization

Level 2: Emotional Content Processing  
├── Explicit consent for trauma-related content
├── Emotional tone analysis and memory
├── Therapeutic-style conversation prompts
└── Crisis intervention protocols

Level 3: Memory Evolution & Contradiction Handling
├── Permission to store multiple memory versions
├── Consent for perspective evolution tracking
├── Authority to challenge or reframe memories
└── Integration of conflicting narratives
```

**Dynamic Consent Mechanisms:**
- **Session-Based Consent**: "Are you comfortable discussing difficult memories today?"
- **Content-Triggered Consent**: AI recognizes trauma indicators and requests explicit permission
- **Withdrawal Protocols**: Immediate cessation of sensitive processing upon user request

### 3.2 Emotional Safeguards

**AI Response Calibration:**
```json
{
  "emotional_safety_protocols": {
    "trauma_detection": {
      "keywords": ["abuse", "death", "violence", "trauma"],
      "sentiment_threshold": -0.8,
      "action": "request_explicit_consent"
    },
    "crisis_indicators": {
      "phrases": ["want to die", "hurt myself", "can't go on"],
      "action": "provide_resources_and_gentle_redirect"
    },
    "healing_recognition": {
      "growth_language": ["learned", "stronger", "grateful"],
      "action": "acknowledge_progress"
    }
  }
}
```

**Crisis Intervention Protocol:**
1. **Detection**: AI identifies crisis language or extreme distress
2. **Gentle Pause**: "I can hear this is really difficult. Would you like to pause?"
3. **Resource Offering**: Crisis hotlines, professional resources
4. **Memory Protection**: Option to not save crisis-related content
5. **Follow-up**: Check-in prompts in subsequent sessions

---

## 4. Data Encryption and Storage Policies

### 4.1 Encryption Standards

**In-Transit Encryption:**
- **TLS 1.3** for all API communications
- **WebRTC DTLS-SRTP** for real-time voice streaming (OpenAI Realtime API)
- **Certificate Pinning** to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks

**At-Rest Encryption:**
```
Voice Recordings: AES-256-GCM with user-specific keys
Transcripts: AES-256-GCM with field-level encryption
Memory Vectors: AES-256-GCM in Chroma DB
User Metadata: Database-level encryption (PostgreSQL TDE)
```

**Key Management:**
- **AWS KMS** or **HashiCorp Vault** for encryption key management
- **Per-user encryption keys** for maximum data isolation
- **Key rotation** every 90 days
- **Zero-knowledge architecture**: Storyline cannot decrypt user content without user authentication

### 4.2 Storage Architecture

**Data Sovereignty:**
```
Local Storage (iOS/Android):
├── SQLite with SQLCipher encryption
├── Voice recordings encrypted locally
├── Transcripts cached with local keys
└── Memory indices for offline access

Cloud Storage (Firebase/Supabase):
├── Encrypted user content buckets
├── Geographically isolated data centers
├── EU data residency for GDPR compliance
└── Automatic backup encryption
```

**Data Minimization:**
- Raw audio deleted after transcription (unless user explicitly saves)
- Temporary processing data purged after 24 hours
- Analytics data anonymized and aggregated
- No unnecessary metadata collection

```

**Selective Memory Deletion:**
- **Scene-Level**: Delete specific recording sessions
- **Topic-Level**: Remove all content about specific subjects
- **Emotion-Level**: Delete memories marked with specific emotional tones
- **Time-Based**: Remove all content from specific date ranges
- **Complete Erasure**: Full project or account deletion

### 5.2 Data Portability Standards

**Export Formats:**
```json

## 6. Privacy-by-Design Principles for Voice AI

### 6.1 Voice Processing Privacy

**Local-First Processing:**
```
Voice Input Pipeline:
1. Local voice activity detection (on-device)
2. Streaming to AssemblyAI (encrypted tunnel)
3. Real-time transcription return
4. Local caching with user keys
5. Cloud sync only if user enabled
```

**Voice Data Minimization:**
- **Temporary Storage**: Raw audio deleted after successful transcription
- **Voice Prints**: No biometric voice identification stored
- **Background Noise**: Filtered out before cloud processing
- **Silence Periods**: Not transmitted to reduce data exposure

### 6.2 AI Conversation Privacy

**Conversation Boundary Management:**
```python
class ConversationPrivacy:
    def __init__(self):
        self.session_memory = {}  # Temporary, cleared after session
        self.persistent_memory = {}  # User-controlled, encrypted
        self.sharing_boundaries = {
            "between_projects": False,  # Default: strict isolation
            "with_writing_assistant": True,  # User configurable
            "for_improvement": "anonymized_only"
        }
    
    def process_conversation(self, input_text, user_consent):
        if self.contains_sensitive_content(input_text):
            consent_granted = self.request_explicit_consent()
            if not consent_granted:
                return self.gentle_redirect()
        
        # Continue with privacy-preserving processing
```

**Context Isolation:**
- **Project Boundaries**: AI memories don't leak between different memoir projects
- **Session Isolation**: Conversations can be marked as "temporary" and not saved
- **Emotional Boundaries**: User can mark topics as "private" (AI aware but doesn't reference)

## 7. Security Measures for Real-Time Voice Streaming

### 7.1 Secure WebRTC Implementation

**Connection Security:**
```
WebRTC Security Stack:
├── DTLS 1.2+ for data channel encryption
├── SRTP for media stream encryption
├── ICE with authenticated STUN/TURN servers
├── Certificate-based authentication
└── Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)
```

**Stream Protection:**
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Voice never travels unencrypted
- **Session Keys**: Unique encryption keys per conversation session
- **Connection Verification**: Certificate pinning prevents MITM attacks
- **Secure Signaling**: WebSocket connections with TLS 1.3

### 7.2 Real-Time Processing Security

**OpenAI Realtime API Security:**
- **Token-Based Authentication**: Short-lived JWT tokens
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse and unauthorized access
- **Content Filtering**: Block malicious or inappropriate prompts
- **Session Management**: Automatic session termination on inactivity

**Voice Activity Detection (VAD):**
```javascript
const secureVAD = {
  processLocally: true,  // Never send silence to servers
  threshold: -50,        // dB threshold for voice detection
  bufferSize: 1024,      // Minimal buffer for privacy
  noiseReduction: true,  // Remove background noise locally
  voicePrintProtection: true  // Prevent voice biometric collection
};
```

---

### 7.3 Application Security

**Prompt Injection Defense**:
- **Input Sanitization**: A sanitization layer will be implemented in the `ai-orchestrator` to remove or neutralize keywords and phrases commonly used in prompt injection attacks (e.g., "ignore previous instructions", "act as").
- **Instructional Prompts**: System prompts will be designed to clearly delineate between the AI's instructions and user-provided content, reducing the risk of malicious overrides.
- **Output Monitoring**: AI-generated responses will be monitored for unexpected deviations from the intended persona or task, which could indicate a successful prompt injection.

**Resource Exhaustion (Denial of Service) Prevention**:
- **Query Complexity Analysis**: The `memory` service will include a pre-execution analysis of incoming queries. Queries that are deemed too complex or computationally expensive (e.g., overly broad semantic searches, deep graph traversals) will be rejected to prevent resource exhaustion.
- **Rate Limiting**: In addition to API-level rate limiting, we will implement resource-based rate limiting on the `memory` service to prevent a single user from monopolizing database resources.

**Secure Inter-Service Communication**:
- **Mutual TLS (mTLS)**: While not strictly required for local development, all inter-service communication in the staging and production environments **must** be secured using mTLS. This will be enforced via a service mesh (e.g., Istio) in the Kubernetes cluster, ensuring that all traffic between microservices is encrypted and authenticated.

## 8. Data Retention and Deletion Policies

### 8.1 Retention Schedule

| Data Type | Retention Period | Justification | User Control |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|--------------|
| **Voice Recordings** | User-defined (default: immediate deletion post-transcription) | Minimize sensitive audio exposure | Full control |
| **Transcripts** | User-defined (default: project lifetime) | Core functionality requirement | Granular deletion |
| **AI Conversations** | User-defined (default: 2 years) | Memory continuity for memoir writing | Session-by-session control |
| **Memory Vectors** | Tied to source content | Semantic search functionality | Automatic deletion with source |
| **User Account Data** | 30 days post-deletion request | Legal compliance buffer | Immediate upon request |
| **Analytics (Anonymized)** | 2 years | Service improvement | Opt-out available |
| **Error Logs** | 90 days | Technical debugging | No personal data included |
| **Payment Information** | Per payment processor requirements | Billing compliance | Standard deletion rights |

### 8.2 Automated Deletion Workflows

**Smart Retention Management:**
```python
class DataRetentionManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.user_preferences = self.load_user_retention_settings()
    
    def schedule_deletion(self, content_type, creation_date, user_id):
        retention_period = self.user_preferences.get(content_type)
        deletion_date = creation_date + retention_period
        
        # Schedule automated deletion
        self.queue_deletion_task(content_type, user_id, deletion_date)
    
    def execute_deletion(self, content_id):
        # Secure deletion: overwrite data multiple times
        self.secure_overwrite(content_id, passes=3)
        self.remove_from_backups(content_id)
        self.log_deletion_completion(content_id)
```

**User-Initiated Deletion:**
- **Immediate Processing**: Deletion requests processed within 72 hours
- **Verification**: Email confirmation for major deletions
- **Cascade Deletion**: Related data automatically removed
- **Backup Cleanup**: Deleted data removed from all backup systems
