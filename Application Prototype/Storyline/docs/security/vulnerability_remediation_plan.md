# Vulnerability Remediation Plan

**Version**: 1.0
**Date**: August 1, 2025

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the process and responsibilities for addressing security vulnerabilities identified during penetration tests, security audits, or continuous monitoring of the Storyline backend services. The goal is to ensure timely and effective remediation to maintain the security posture of the application.

## 2. Vulnerability Prioritization

Vulnerabilities will be prioritized based on their severity and potential impact, using a combination of CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) and internal risk assessment.

| Severity | Description | Remediation SLA |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Critical** | Direct impact on data confidentiality, integrity, or availability; easy to exploit. | 24 hours |
| **High** | Significant impact; requires specific conditions to exploit. | 72 hours |
| **Medium** | Moderate impact; requires complex conditions or user interaction to exploit. | 7 days |
| **Low** | Minor impact; informational or best practice recommendation. | 30 days |

## 3. Remediation Workflow

1.  **Identification**: Vulnerabilities are identified through penetration tests, automated scans, bug bounty programs, or internal code reviews.
2.  **Reporting**: All vulnerabilities are reported to the Security Team and logged in the designated issue tracking system (e.g., Jira, GitHub Issues).
3.  **Validation**: The Security Team validates the vulnerability, confirms its reproducibility, and assigns a severity level.
4.  **Assignment**: The vulnerability is assigned to the relevant development team or engineer responsible for the affected service.
5.  **Remediation**: The assigned team develops and implements a fix. This may involve code changes, configuration updates, or infrastructure modifications.
6.  **Verification**: The Security Team (or an independent QA engineer) verifies the fix through re-testing to ensure the vulnerability is fully mitigated and no new issues have been introduced.
7.  **Closure**: Once verified, the vulnerability is marked as closed in the tracking system.

## 4. Responsibilities

-   **Security Team**: Overall ownership of the vulnerability management process, prioritization, validation, and final verification.
-   **Development Teams**: Responsible for implementing fixes within the defined SLAs.
-   **DevOps Team**: Responsible for deploying fixes and ensuring infrastructure-level security.

## 5. Communication

-   **Internal**: Regular updates on critical and high-severity vulnerabilities will be provided to relevant stakeholders (e.g., Product, Engineering Leadership).
-   **External**: For publicly disclosed vulnerabilities or data breaches, communication will follow the Incident Response Plan outlined in `docs/security/privacy-spec.md`.

## 6. Tools

-   **Issue Tracking**: [Jira/GitHub Issues]
-   **Vulnerability Scanners**: [OWASP ZAP, Nessus, Qualys]
-   **Code Scanners**: [SonarQube, Snyk]

## 7. Continuous Improvement

-   **Post-Mortems**: For critical vulnerabilities, a post-mortem will be conducted to identify root causes and implement preventative measures.
-   **Training**: Regular security training for development teams to raise awareness and promote secure coding practices.
-   **Process Review**: Annual review of the vulnerability remediation process to identify areas for improvement.
