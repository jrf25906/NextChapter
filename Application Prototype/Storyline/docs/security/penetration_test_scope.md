# Simulated Penetration Test Scope for Storyline Backend

**Version**: 1.0
**Date**: August 1, 2025

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the scope for a simulated third-party penetration test targeting the backend services of the Storyline application. The objective is to identify security vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and potential attack vectors that could compromise data integrity, confidentiality, or availability.

## 2. Scope of Testing

The penetration test will focus on the following backend services and their interactions:

### 2.1 Core API Service (`services/api`)
-   **Authentication & Authorization**: Testing for bypasses, weak credentials, session management flaws, and privilege escalation.
-   **Input Validation**: Testing for SQL injection, XSS (if applicable via API responses), command injection, and other input-related vulnerabilities.
-   **API Endpoints**: Comprehensive testing of all exposed REST endpoints for insecure direct object references (IDOR), mass assignment, and other API-specific vulnerabilities.
-   **Error Handling**: Analysis of error messages for information disclosure.

### 2.2 Authentication Service (`services/auth`)
-   **User Registration & Login**: Testing for enumeration, brute-force, and account takeover vulnerabilities.
-   **Password Management**: Testing password reset flows, weak password policies, and storage.
-   **Session Management**: Testing token validity, logout functionality, and session fixation.

### 2.3 AI Orchestrator Service (`services/ai-orchestrator`)
-   **Prompt Injection**: Advanced testing for prompt injection, including indirect and recursive injection scenarios.
-   **AI Model Abuse**: Testing for denial of service via complex prompts, data exfiltration through AI responses, and unintended model behaviors.
-   **Third-Party AI Integrations**: Secure handling of API keys, rate limiting, and data exchange with OpenAI, Anthropic, AssemblyAI, and Deepgram.

### 2.4 Memory Service (`services/memory`)
-   **Data Confidentiality**: Testing for unauthorized access to user memories, including semantic and graph data.
-   **Query Complexity**: Testing for resource exhaustion attacks via complex or recursive queries to Chroma DB and Neo4j.
-   **Data Integrity**: Testing for unauthorized modification or deletion of memory data.
-   **Privacy-Preserving Features**: Validation of encryption, noise injection, and data residency controls.

### 2.5 Narrative Analysis Service (`services/narrative-analysis`)
-   **Input Processing**: Testing for vulnerabilities in text processing and analysis functions.
-   **Data Consumption**: Secure consumption of data from the `memory` service.
-   **Output Integrity**: Ensuring the integrity of analysis results and preventing manipulation.

### 2.6 Inter-Service Communication
-   **Network Segmentation**: Verification of proper network segmentation between microservices.
-   **mTLS Enforcement**: Confirmation that mTLS is enforced for all internal API calls in production-like environments.
-   **Data in Transit**: Verification of encryption for all data exchanged between services.

## 3. Testing Methodology

The penetration test will employ a combination of automated tools and manual techniques, including:
-   **Black Box Testing**: Simulating an external attacker with no prior knowledge of the system.
-   **Gray Box Testing**: Simulating an authenticated user with limited privileges.
-   **Vulnerability Scanning**: Using industry-standard tools for common web application and API vulnerabilities.
-   **Manual Exploitation**: Attempting to exploit identified vulnerabilities.
-   **Configuration Review**: Reviewing server and service configurations for security best practices.

## 4. Deliverables

Upon completion of the test, the following will be provided:
-   **Executive Summary**: High-level overview of findings and overall security posture.
-   **Detailed Findings Report**: Comprehensive list of identified vulnerabilities, including severity, impact, and recommended remediation steps.
-   **Proof-of-Concept (PoC)**: For critical and high-severity findings, a PoC will be provided to demonstrate exploitability.
-   **Remediation Guidance**: Specific, actionable recommendations for fixing each vulnerability.

## 5. Exclusions

-   Frontend (mobile and web) application testing (separate scope).
-   Physical security assessments.
-   Social engineering.
-   Denial of Service (DoS) attacks (unless specifically approved and controlled).

## 6. Timeline

-   **Week 1**: Planning, reconnaissance, and initial automated scans.
-   **Week 2-3**: Manual testing, vulnerability exploitation, and deep-dive analysis.
-   **Week 4**: Reporting and debriefing.
