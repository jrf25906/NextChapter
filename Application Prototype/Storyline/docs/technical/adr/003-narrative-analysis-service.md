# ADR 003: Narrative Analysis Service

**Date**: 2025-08-01

**Status**: Accepted

## Context

The Storyline application requires advanced capabilities to analyze narrative structures, track character development, and provide writing craft guidance. Integrating these complex AI-driven features directly into existing services (like `ai-orchestrator` or `memory`) would lead to monolithic codebases, hinder independent development, and complicate scaling.

## Decision

We will create a new, dedicated microservice named `narrative-analysis` to encapsulate all logic related to narrative intelligence.

## Rationale

-   **Separation of Concerns**: This service will be solely responsible for analyzing story content, identifying narrative patterns, and providing insights, keeping the `ai-orchestrator` focused on conversational AI and the `memory` service on data storage and retrieval.
-   **Independent Scalability**: Narrative analysis can be computationally intensive. A separate service allows us to scale its resources (e.g., CPU, GPU if needed for future ML models) independently of other services based on demand.
-   **Specialized Technology Stack**: This service may require specific libraries or frameworks for NLP, graph analysis, or machine learning that are not necessary for other services, simplifying dependency management.
-   **Clear API Boundary**: Defines a clear contract for how other services (primarily `ai-orchestrator`) will request and consume narrative insights.
-   **Team Autonomy**: Allows a dedicated team or individual to focus on developing and optimizing narrative intelligence features without impacting other parts of the system.

## Consequences

-   **Increased Operational Overhead**: Adds another microservice to manage, monitor, and deploy.
-   **Inter-Service Communication**: Requires careful design of APIs and data flow between `narrative-analysis`, `memory`, and `ai-orchestrator` services.
-   **Data Synchronization**: The `narrative-analysis` service will need efficient mechanisms to consume and process data from the `memory` service.

Despite the added complexity, the benefits of modularity, scalability, and clear ownership for such a critical and evolving feature set outweigh the drawbacks.
