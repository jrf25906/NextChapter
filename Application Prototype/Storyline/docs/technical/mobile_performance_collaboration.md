# Mobile Performance Optimization Collaboration Plan

**Version**: 1.0
**Date**: August 1, 2025

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the collaboration plan between the Backend and Mobile teams to optimize the Storyline application's performance, specifically focusing on CPU and battery consumption. Given the real-time voice processing and AI-intensive features, efficient resource utilization on mobile devices is critical for a positive user experience.

## 2. Goals

-   Achieve target mobile performance metrics (as defined in `docs/technical/architecture.md`):
    -   CPU Usage: ≤8% sustained, ≤15% peak
    -   Battery Consumption: ≤150mA sustained, ≤300mA voice processing
-   Identify and resolve performance bottlenecks across the stack (mobile app, backend services, network).
-   Establish a continuous performance monitoring and testing pipeline.

## 3. Collaboration Areas & Responsibilities

### 3.1 Data Exchange & API Optimization

-   **Backend Team Responsibilities**:
    -   Optimize API responses to minimize data transfer size (e.g., using GraphQL, selective fields).
    -   Implement efficient data serialization/deserialization.
    -   Ensure proper caching headers and strategies for API responses.
    -   Provide clear documentation on API usage patterns and potential performance implications.
-   **Mobile Team Responsibilities**:
    -   Efficiently parse and consume API responses.
    -   Implement client-side caching to reduce redundant API calls.
    -   Minimize data requests and update frequencies.

### 3.2 Real-time Voice Processing

-   **Backend Team Responsibilities**:
    -   Optimize voice processing pipeline for minimal latency and CPU usage (e.g., efficient STT/TTS models, optimized codecs).
    -   Implement adaptive quality mechanisms (e.g., lower audio quality on low battery).
    -   Provide clear metrics on backend voice processing load and latency.
-   **Mobile Team Responsibilities**:
    -   Efficiently capture and stream audio to the backend.
    -   Minimize local audio processing on the device.
    -   Implement adaptive audio capture based on network conditions and battery level.

### 3.3 Background Processing & Synchronization

-   **Backend Team Responsibilities**:
    -   Design background tasks (e.g., memory consolidation, narrative analysis) to be asynchronous and non-blocking.
    -   Provide APIs for efficient incremental synchronization.
-   **Mobile Team Responsibilities**:
    -   Implement efficient background sync strategies (e.g., using WorkManager/BackgroundTasks).
    -   Minimize wake-locks and unnecessary background activity.

## 4. Tools & Monitoring

-   **Backend Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry for backend service metrics (CPU, memory, latency, throughput).
-   **Mobile Profiling**: Xcode Instruments (iOS), Android Studio Profiler (Android) for on-device CPU, memory, and battery usage.
-   **End-to-End Tracing**: OpenTelemetry for tracing requests across mobile and backend services to identify cross-cutting bottlenecks.
-   **Performance Testing**: Shared load testing scripts (`tools/testing/run_load_tests.sh`) and mobile performance benchmarks.

## 5. Communication & Cadence

-   **Bi-weekly Sync Meetings**: Dedicated meetings between leads from both teams to review performance metrics, discuss bottlenecks, and plan optimization efforts.
-   **Shared Dashboards**: Jointly owned Grafana dashboards displaying key performance indicators for both mobile and backend.
-   **Dedicated Slack Channel**: For quick communication and issue resolution.
-   **Joint Debugging Sessions**: When complex performance issues arise, both teams will collaborate in real-time debugging sessions.

## 6. Performance Budget Enforcement

-   **CI/CD Integration**: Mobile performance benchmarks will be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline. Builds exceeding defined CPU or battery budgets will fail, preventing performance regressions.
-   **Alerting**: Automated alerts will be configured for significant deviations from performance baselines in production.
