# Storyline Technical Architecture Recommendations

*Based on comprehensive research of 2025 AI/voice technologies*

## 🎯 Core Recommendations Summary

**You were absolutely right about Whisper** - it's not optimal for real-time conversational memoir writing. Here's what the research revealed:

---

## 🎤 Speech-to-Text: AssemblyAI Universal-Streaming

**Winner: AssemblyAI Universal-Streaming**
- **300ms latency (P50)** - crucial for conversational AI flow
- **Optimized for conversational speech** - handles emotional tone, disfluencies, natural speech patterns
- **Immutable transcripts** - won't change mid-conversation (important for memoir consistency)
- **99.95% uptime SLA** - production reliability
- **Cost:** ~$0.37 per hour of audio

**Why not Whisper:**
- Batch-optimized, not designed for real-time streaming
- Higher latency for conversational scenarios
- Better for post-processing than live conversation

**Alternative:** Deepgram Nova-3 (released February 2025) claims "54.3% reduction in word error rate for streaming" but AssemblyAI has better track record for memoir-style emotional content.

## 🎵 Text-to-Speech: Deepgram Aura-2

**Winner: Deepgram Aura-2**
- **Sub-200ms latency** - essential for natural conversation
- **Enterprise-grade** - handles domain-specific terminology well
- **40+ English voices** with localized accents
- **$0.030 per 1,000 characters** - cost-effective
- **Shared infrastructure** with STT for consistency

**Alternative for Personas:** ElevenLabs v3 "combines sophisticated neural network models with proprietary algorithms to ensure voice outputs sound remarkably natural, with authentic annotation, rhythm, and emotion" - better for the different AI personas feature, but higher cost.

---

## 🧠 LLM Strategy: Hybrid Claude + GPT-4o

**Primary: Claude 3.5 Sonnet for Writing**
- "Claude nailed my conversation style and format" for writing assistance
- **200k context window** - handles book-length projects
- **Better for emotional sensitivity** in memoir content
- **Cost:** $3 per 1M input tokens, $15 per 1M output tokens

**Secondary: GPT-4o for Real-time Conversation**
- **Memory features** - "ChatGPT has one killer feature: Memory"
- **OpenAI Realtime API compatibility**
- **Faster conversational responses**
- **Cost:** $5 per 1M input tokens, $20 per 1M output tokens

**Strategy:** Use Claude for writing assistance/rewriting, GPT-4o for real-time voice conversations.

---

## 🗣️ Real-time Conversation: OpenAI Realtime API

**Winner: OpenAI Realtime API**
- **Production-ready** WebRTC implementation
- **Automatic interruption handling** - natural conversation flow
- **Direct speech-to-speech** - preserves emotional nuance
- **Function calling support** - can trigger app actions during conversation
- **Audio Cost:** $0.06 per minute input, $0.24 per minute output

**Architecture:** "The Realtime API improves this by streaming audio inputs and outputs directly, enabling more natural conversational experiences"

---

## 📱 Mobile Implementation: React Native WebRTC

**Winner: react-native-webrtc**
- **Most mature library** for React Native WebRTC integration
- **Cross-platform** iOS/Android support
- **Active community** and continuous updates
- **WebRTC compatibility** with OpenAI Realtime API

**Additional Libraries:**
- `react-native-audio-recorder-player` for basic recording
- `react-native-sound` for audio playback
- Platform-specific permission handling

---

## 🧩 Memory & Context Management: Chroma + Hierarchical Strategy

**Winner: Chroma DB**
- **Developer-friendly** - perfect for MVP and iteration
- **Embedded mode** - runs alongside React Native app
- **Excellent for memoir content** - handles emotional context well
- **Free for development** - low barrier to entry
- **Easy migration path** to Pinecone for scale

**Memory Architecture:**
```
📚 Book Level (200k tokens) → Claude context
📖 Chapter Level (50k tokens) → Indexed in Chroma  
🎯 Scene Level (5k tokens) → Real-time conversation
💭 Emotional State → Metadata tags
```

---

## 💰 Cost Analysis (Per Hour of Usage)

**Conservative Estimate:**
- **STT:** $0.37 (AssemblyAI)
- **TTS:** $0.90 (Aura-2, ~500 words generated)
- **LLM Conversation:** $1.20 (GPT-4o, ~2k tokens in/out)
- **LLM Writing:** $0.60 (Claude, rewriting segments)
- **Infrastructure:** $0.10 (hosting, vector DB)

**Total: ~$3.17 per hour** of active voice conversation + writing assistance.

For memoir writing (typical 1-2 hours/week), monthly cost per user: **$25-50**.

*Note: This aligns with the cost analysis in storyline_prd.md*

## 🚀 Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: MVP (4-6 weeks)
1. AssemblyAI STT + basic recording
2. Claude text chat for writing assistance  
3. Simple chapter organization
4. Basic Chroma memory storage

### Phase 2: Voice Conversation (6-8 weeks)
5. OpenAI Realtime API integration
6. React Native WebRTC implementation
7. Deepgram Aura-2 TTS
8. Turn-taking and interruption handling

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (8-10 weeks)
9. Emotional state tracking
10. Voice personas (ElevenLabs integration)
11. Memory versioning for narrative contradictions
12. Advanced export features

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

```
📱 React Native App
├── react-native-webrtc (real-time audio)
├── AssemblyAI Universal-Streaming (STT)
├── OpenAI Realtime API (conversation)
├── Claude 3.5 Sonnet (writing assistance)
├── Deepgram Aura-2 (TTS)
├── Chroma DB (memory/context)
└── Firebase/Supabase (auth, storage, sync)
```

## ⚠️ Key Risks & Mitigation

1. **Latency Chain:** Test end-to-end latency early; target <1.5s total
2. **Emotional Content:** Implement content warnings and user consent flows
3. **Memory Accuracy:** Build "memory editing" UI for user control
4. **Voice Fatigue:** Provide seamless voice↔text switching
5. **Costs at Scale:** Implement usage monitoring and tier-based pricing

---

## 🎯 Why This Stack Wins for Memoir Writing

- **Emotional Intelligence:** AssemblyAI + Claude handle emotional speech patterns
- **Narrative Consistency:** Chroma's memory + Claude's writing assistance
- **Natural Conversation:** OpenAI Realtime API feels like talking to a writing partner
- **Cost Efficiency:** Balanced performance/cost for target market
- **Development Speed:** Proven libraries reduce technical risk

This architecture gives you a **production-ready foundation** that can scale from MVP to thousands of users while maintaining the intimate, supportive experience memoir writers need.
