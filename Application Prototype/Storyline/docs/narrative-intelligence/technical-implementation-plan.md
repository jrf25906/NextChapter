- **Mobile App**: `/apps/mobile/` - New narrative guidance interfaces

### New Components
- **Narrative Analysis Engine**: Real-time story structure and quality assessment
- **Writing Craft Knowledge Base**: Structured repository of narrative frameworks
- **Story Context Manager**: Advanced memory system for narrative continuity

## Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)

### Objectives
