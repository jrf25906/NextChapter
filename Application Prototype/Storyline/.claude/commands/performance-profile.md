Check voice latency (<200ms) and memory retrieval speed (<100ms) against Storyline performance targets.

!cd tests/performance && npm run test:latency
!cd tests/performance/voice-latency && npm run test:voice-timing
!cd tests/performance/memory-speed && npm run test:memory-timing
!cd tests/performance/concurrent-users && npm run test:load

Validate performance against targets:
- **Voice Processing**: <200ms real-time transcription latency
- **Memory Retrieval**: <100ms context query response time
- **AI Response**: <2 seconds for narrative analysis
- **Concurrent Users**: Support target user load
- **Resource Usage**: CPU and memory within limits

Generate performance report showing:
- Current vs. target metrics
- Performance bottlenecks identified
- Resource utilization patterns
- Recommendations for optimization

Flag any metrics exceeding acceptable thresholds for immediate attention.
