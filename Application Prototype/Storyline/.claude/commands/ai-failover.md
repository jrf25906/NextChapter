Test AI provider failover between OpenAI, Claude, AssemblyAI, and Deepgram services.

!cd services/ai-orchestrator && npm run test:failover
!cd tests/integration && npm run test:provider-switching
!cd services/ai-orchestrator/src/providers && npm run test:health-checks

Validate AI service resilience:
- **Graceful Failover**: Seamless switching between providers
- **Health Monitoring**: Real-time AI service status tracking
- **Consistency**: Maintained persona across different AI providers
- **Cost Optimization**: Intelligent routing based on cost/performance
- **Error Handling**: Appropriate fallbacks for service outages

Test failover scenarios:
- OpenAI API outage → Claude fallback
- AssemblyAI voice failure → Deepgram switch
- Rate limiting → provider rotation
- Service degradation → performance-based routing
- Complete provider failure → graceful error messaging

Ensure users experience minimal disruption during AI service issues while maintaining conversation quality and persona consistency.
