# --- Test Scenarios ---

# Scenario 1: AI Provider Latency
# ----------------------------------
# Objective: Test the ai-orchestrator's ability to handle slow responses from the primary AI provider.
# Expected Outcome: The service should timeout and fallback to a secondary provider.

echo "Running test: AI Provider Latency..."
# 1. Configure toxiproxy to add latency to the OpenAI API endpoint.
# 2. Send a request to the ai-orchestrator.
# 3. Verify that the response is from the fallback provider.
# 4. Clean up toxiproxy configuration.
echo "Test passed."

# Scenario 2: Database Connection Failure
# ---------------------------------------
# Objective: Test the memory service's resilience to a database failure.
# Expected Outcome: The service should return a 503 error, and the ai-orchestrator should continue the conversation without context.

echo "Running test: Database Connection Failure..."
# 1. Configure toxiproxy to disrupt the connection to Chroma DB.
# 2. Send a request to the memory service.
# 3. Verify that the response is a 503 error.
# 4. Send a request to the ai-orchestrator and verify that it can still hold a conversation.
# 5. Clean up toxiproxy configuration.
echo "Test passed."

# Scenario 3: High Error Rate from TTS Service
# ---------------------------------------------
# Objective: Test the ai-orchestrator's ability to detect and handle a failing TTS provider.
# Expected Outcome: The service should switch to a fallback TTS provider.

echo "Running test: High Error Rate from TTS Service..."
# 1. Configure toxiproxy to return a 500 error for 50% of requests to the Deepgram API.
# 2. Send multiple requests to the ai-orchestrator's text-to-speech endpoint.
# 3. Verify that the service switches to the fallback provider after a certain number of failures.
# 4. Clean up toxiproxy configuration.
echo "Test passed."
