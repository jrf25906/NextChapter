# Storyline Bias Testing Script
#
# This script simulates running bias tests against the memory and narrative analysis golden datasets.
# In a real scenario, this would involve more sophisticated analysis and potentially ML models.

# This would involve:

# 2. Sending queries to the memory service
# 3. Analyzing the responses for fairness and accuracy across different simulated demographics
# 4. Logging any detected biases
