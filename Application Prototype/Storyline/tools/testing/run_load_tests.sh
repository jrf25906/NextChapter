# This script is a placeholder for comprehensive load testing across all backend services.
# It will simulate concurrent users interacting with the Storyline application.

# --- Load Test Scenarios (Simplified) ---
# In a real scenario, these would be more complex, e.g., using k6 or JMeter scripts

# Scenario 1: User Onboarding (Auth Service)
echo "Running load test for Auth Service (User Onboarding)..."
# Simulate N concurrent users signing up/logging in
sleep 5 # Simulate work
echo "Auth Service load test completed."

# Scenario 2: Conversation Flow (AI Orchestrator, Memory, Narrative Analysis, Voice Processing)
echo "Running load test for Conversation Flow..."
# Simulate N concurrent users having conversations, triggering memory and narrative analysis
sleep 10 # Simulate work
echo "Conversation Flow load test completed."

# Scenario 3: Content Management (API Service)
echo "Running load test for API Service (Content Management)..."
# Simulate N concurrent users creating/editing/exporting content
sleep 5 # Simulate work
echo "API Service load test completed."

echo "Comprehensive load testing simulation complete."
