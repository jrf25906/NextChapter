# NextChapter Accessibility Audit Report

## Audit Date: January 13, 2025

## Executive Summary
This audit evaluates the NextChapter app's compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards and identifies accessibility barriers for users, particularly those in vulnerable states after job loss. Critical issues were found in touch target sizes, screen reader support, and crisis resource accessibility.

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. Touch Target Sizes (WCAG 2.5.5)
**Severity: High**
**Components Affected:**
- Button.tsx: Small variant (36dp) below 48dp minimum
- MessageInput.tsx: Send button (36x36) below minimum
- CrisisAlert.tsx: Dismiss button (24x24 icon) critically small

**Impact:** Users under stress may struggle to tap buttons accurately, leading to frustration.

### 2. Screen Reader Support (WCAG 1.3.1, 4.1.2)
**Severity: High**
**Components Affected:**
- MessageBubble.tsx: Missing accessibilityHint for tone indicators
- Button.tsx: Missing accessibility properties entirely
- Input.tsx: No accessibilityLabel or error announcements
- CrisisAlert.tsx: Good implementation but needs refinement

**Impact:** Vision-impaired users cannot fully understand interface elements.

### 3. Color Contrast (WCAG 1.4.3)
**Severity: Medium**
**Issues Found:**
- Light theme placeholder text (#9CA3AF on #FFFFFF) = 2.73:1 (fails)
- Warning buttons on warning background need verification
- Text on primary buttons needs verification

**Impact:** Low vision users may struggle to read text.

### 4. Error Messaging (WCAG 3.3.1)
**Severity: Medium**
**Components Affected:**
- Input.tsx: Errors not announced to screen readers
- LoginScreen.tsx: Error dismissal not keyboard accessible

**Impact:** Users may not understand what went wrong or how to fix it.

### 5. Loading States (WCAG 4.1.3)
**Severity: Medium**
**Components Affected:**
- LoadingOverlay.tsx: No live region announcements
- Button.tsx: Loading state not announced

**Impact:** Screen reader users don't know when actions are processing.

### 6. Crisis Intervention Accessibility
**Severity: Critical**
**Positive Findings:**
- CrisisAlert uses assertive live regions
- Large touch targets for crisis buttons
- Clear labeling

**Issues:**
- Critical alerts cannot be dismissed (good for safety)
- Need to ensure crisis resources are always reachable via keyboard shortcut
