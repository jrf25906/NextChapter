## In Progress ðŸš§

### High Priority Tasks
1. **Install OpenAI SDK**: `npm install openai`
2. **Connect Screens to Stores**: Wire up UI with state management
3. **Authentication Flow**: Implement sign in/up screens

### Medium Priority Tasks
1. **Offline Data Sync**: Complete sync manager implementation
2. **Error Boundaries**: Add to all screens
3. **Loading States**: App-wide loading indicators

## Upcoming Features ðŸ“‹

### Next Sprint (High Priority)
- Wire up auth flow (sign in, sign up, forgot password)
- Connect all screens to navigation and stores
- Implement push notifications with Expo Push API
- Add biometric authentication support

### Future Sprints (Medium Priority)
- Implement mood tracking with chart visualization
- Create resume scanner feature
- Add error boundaries to all screens
- Set up E2E tests with Detox
- Configure CI/CD pipeline

### Backlog (Low Priority)
- Analytics integration (PostHog/Amplitude)
- Peer Connect feature
- Advanced coach customization
- Export features for job applications

## Technical Debt
1. **Testing Coverage**: Need to increase from current baseline
2. **Performance Optimization**: Bundle size monitoring
3. **Documentation**: API documentation for services
4. **Code Cleanup**: Remove unused imports and dead code

## Known Issues
1. Path alias for `@context/AuthContext` works but shows warnings
2. Some TypeScript strict mode violations in older components
3. AsyncStorage size limits need monitoring
4. iOS simulator performance with React Navigation

## Performance Metrics
- **Bundle Size**: TBD (need to measure)
- **Cold Start**: Target <3s (not yet measured)
- **Memory Usage**: Target <200MB (not yet measured)
- **Test Coverage**: ~30% (need to improve to 80%)

## Next Actions
1. Run `npm install openai` to enable AI Coach
2. Connect screens to stores and navigation
3. Implement auth flow with Supabase
4. Begin testing core user flows
5. Set up continuous integration

## Development Guidelines
- Follow TDD approach - write tests first
- Ensure accessibility on all new features
- Keep bundle size under control
- Document all API integrations
- Use TypeScript strict mode

## Release Planning
### MVP Features (v1.0)
- âœ… Core navigation
- âœ… Basic screens
- âœ… State management
- ðŸš§ Authentication
- ðŸš§ Bounce Plan tasks
- ðŸš§ AI Coach (basic)
- ðŸ“‹ Job tracker
- ðŸ“‹ Budget calculator

### Post-MVP (v1.1+)

## Team Notes
- Supabase is fully configured - no additional setup needed
- OpenAI integration ready but needs API key in env
- All UI components follow stress-friendly design principles
- Navigation structure supports future feature additions
