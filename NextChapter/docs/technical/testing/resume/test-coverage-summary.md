## Next Steps (Green Phase - Implementation)

Now that all tests are written and failing (Red phase), proceed with implementation:

1. **Create Type Definitions** ✅
   - `/types/resume.ts` - Already created

2. **Implement Services**
   - `/services/resume/resumeParser.ts`
   - `/services/resume/resumeAI.ts`
   - `/services/resume/index.ts`

3. **Implement Store**
   - `/stores/resumeStore.ts`

4. **Implement Components**
   - `/components/feature/resume/ResumeCard.tsx`
   - `/components/feature/resume/AnalysisResults.tsx`
   - `/components/feature/resume/RewriteModal.tsx`
   - `/components/feature/resume/index.ts`

5. **Implement Screen**
   - `/screens/resume/ResumeScannerScreen.tsx`
   - `/screens/resume/index.ts`

6. **Integration**
   - Update navigation to include Resume Scanner
   - Add to tab navigator
   - Update analytics events

## SOLID Principles Checklist

- [ ] **SRP**: Each service/component has single responsibility
- [ ] **OCP**: Extensible for new file types/analysis features
- [ ] **LSP**: Resume types are substitutable
- [ ] **ISP**: Separate interfaces for parsing vs AI features
- [ ] **DIP**: Services depend on interfaces, not implementations

## Security Checklist

- [ ] Never send full resume to AI without consent
- [ ] Sanitize PII before AI processing
- [ ] Encrypt resume content in local storage
- [ ] Implement proper rate limiting
- [ ] Secure API key storage

## Accessibility Checklist

- [ ] All interactive elements have labels
- [ ] Color contrast meets WCAG 2.1 AA
- [ ] Touch targets ≥ 48x48dp
- [ ] Screen reader announcements for state changes
- [ ] Keyboard navigation support
