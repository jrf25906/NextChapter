# Error Boundary Implementation Guide

## Overview

All 25 screens in the Next Chapter app now have error boundaries implemented using a reusable HOC pattern. This ensures graceful error handling throughout the app with stress-friendly, empathetic messaging for users going through career transitions.

## Implementation Pattern

### The withErrorBoundary HOC

```typescript
export function withErrorBoundary<P extends object>(
  Component: React.ComponentType<P>,
  errorMessage: string = 'We're having trouble loading this screen. Your progress is safe.'
): React.ComponentType<P> {
  const WrappedComponent = React.forwardRef<any, P>((props, ref) => {
    const [errorKey, setErrorKey] = React.useState(0);

    return (
      <ErrorBoundary
        key={errorKey}
        message={errorMessage}
        onReset={() => setErrorKey(prev => prev + 1)}
      >
        <Component {...props} ref={ref} />
      </ErrorBoundary>
    );
  });

  WrappedComponent.displayName = `withErrorBoundary(${Component.displayName || Component.name})`;
  
  return WrappedComponent;
}
```

## Key Features

### 1. Stress-Friendly Design
- Calming blue heart icon instead of error symbols
- Warm, supportive messaging
- "Try Again" instead of "Retry"
- Soft colors from the design system

### 2. Empathetic Messaging
Each screen has context-specific messages that:
- Reassure users their data is safe
- Acknowledge the difficulty of their situation
- Avoid technical jargon
- Provide clear next steps

### 3. Accessibility
- Full screen reader support
- ARIA roles and labels
- High contrast text
- Large touch targets (48x48dp minimum)

### 4. Technical Implementation
- TypeScript strict mode compliance
- No inline styles
- Theme integration
- Proper ref forwarding
- Display names for debugging

## Testing

All error boundaries are tested with:
- Component rendering tests
- Error simulation tests
- Reset functionality tests
- Accessibility tests
- Theme integration tests

## Usage Example

```typescript
// Before
export default LoginScreen;

// After
export default withErrorBoundary(
  LoginScreen,
  "We're having trouble with sign in. Your data is safe, and we're here to help."
);
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always use context-specific messages** that relate to the screen's purpose
2. **Reassure users** about data safety and progress preservation
3. **Maintain empathy** - users are going through a difficult time
4. **Test error scenarios** to ensure graceful degradation
5. **Monitor error rates** to identify problematic areas

## Future Enhancements

1. Add error tracking integration (PostHog)
2. Implement retry strategies for transient errors
3. Add offline detection with specific messaging
4. Create error recovery flows for critical paths
5. Add progressive error details for technical users

This implementation ensures that even when things go wrong, users feel supported and confident that their progress toward their next career chapter is safe and valued.
