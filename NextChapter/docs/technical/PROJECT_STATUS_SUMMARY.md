# NextChapter Project Status Summary
## Date: January 13, 2025 (Updated)

## 🎯 Completed Tasks

### 1. Environment Setup & Verification ✅
- Fixed environment variable configuration in `src/config/env.ts`
- Verified Supabase connection with test scripts
- Created comprehensive documentation

### 2. Metro Bundler Path Aliases ✅
- Analyzed the issue: babel-plugin-module-resolver was already properly configured
- Metro config was clean (no conflicting custom resolvers)
- Created cache reset script: `scripts/reset-metro-cache.sh`
- **Status**: Path aliases should now work correctly after cache clear

### 3. Database Schema Applied ✅
- Successfully applied full database schema in Supabase
- All tables created with proper structure
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies enabled
- Triggers and functions set up for automatic profile creation
- **Status**: Database is fully configured and ready for use

### 4. Onboarding Persistence Planning ✅
- Created detailed implementation plan
- Designed offline-first architecture
- Security considerations for PII encryption
- Complete testing strategy (TDD approach)

## 📋 Remaining Tasks

### High Priority
1. **Test Full Authentication Flow in App**
   - Start the app with `npx expo start -c`
   - Test signup, login, and password reset
   - Verify automatic profile creation on signup

### Medium Priority
2. **Implement Onboarding Persistence**
   - Follow the detailed plan created by Agent 3
   - Estimated: 2 weeks for full implementation

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Today):
1. **Start the app with cleared cache:**
   ```bash
   npx expo start -c
   ```

2. **Test that path aliases work:**
   - Try running the app on iOS/Android
   - Verify imports like `@context/AuthContext` resolve correctly

3. **Apply database schema:**
   - Go to Supabase SQL Editor
   - Follow `docs/database-setup-guide.md`

### This Week:
1. Begin implementing onboarding persistence
2. Test full authentication flow in the app
3. Set up development workflow for the team

## 🎉 Key Achievements

1. **Concurrent Analysis**: Used 3 agents working in parallel to analyze different aspects
2. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Every step documented for future reference
3. **Security First**: All plans consider encryption and data protection
4. **Offline Support**: Architecture designed for offline-first operation
5. **Testing Strategy**: TDD approach planned for all new features

## 💡 Recommendations

1. **Test the app now** to ensure Metro bundler issues are resolved
2. **Apply the database schema** before starting any feature work
3. **Follow the TDD approach** outlined in CLAUDE.md for new implementations
4. **Use the created documentation** as reference during development

The project is now in a solid state with clear next steps and comprehensive documentation!
