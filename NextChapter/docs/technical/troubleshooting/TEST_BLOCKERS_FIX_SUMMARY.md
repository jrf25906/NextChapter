# Test Blockers Fix Summary

## Overview
This document details the fixes implemented to resolve the test blockers identified in the React Native testing suite.

## Blockers and Solutions

### 1. **Zustand Store Initialization Error**
**Problem**: `TypeError: store.getState is not a function`
- Occurred when persist middleware wrapped the store
- Mock wasn't handling the middleware chain properly

**Solution**:
- Updated `jest.setup.js` to properly mock Zustand's persist middleware
- Added proper store wrapping in the middleware mock
- Implemented rehydration support for persisted state
- Added `createJSONStorage` mock for AsyncStorage integration

### 2. **Dynamic Import Issues**
**Problem**: `TypeError: A dynamic import callback was invoked without --experimental-vm-modules`
- OfflineContext used dynamic imports for syncManager
- NODE_ENV=test fallback to require() wasn't working

**Solution**:
- Created mock file: `/src/services/database/sync/__mocks__/syncManager.ts`
- Added global mock in `jest.setup.js` for syncManager module
- Updated OfflineContext test to use the mocked module directly

### 3. **Global Timer Functions**
**Problem**: `clearInterval not defined`
- Global timer functions weren't available in all test contexts

**Solution**:
- Enhanced global timer function setup in `jest.setup.js`
- Added checks for undefined before setting
- Created proper mock implementations for all timer functions
- Ensured availability in all execution contexts

### 4. **Network State Updates**
**Problem**: NetInfo mock listener not triggering state changes
- Mock wasn't properly simulating network state changes
- Component state wasn't updating in tests

**Solution**:
- Rewrote NetInfo mock with functional listeners
- Added `__triggerStateChange` helper for tests
- Added `__resetState` helper for test cleanup
- Ensured listener is called immediately on subscription

### 5. **Act Warnings**
**Problem**: Async state updates outside act()
- Multiple warnings about state updates not wrapped in act()

**Solution**:
- Created `test-act-utils.ts` with act wrapper utilities:
  - `actAsync`: Wraps async operations in act()
  - `waitInAct`: Waits within act()
  - `flushPromisesAndTimers`: Flushes all pending operations
- Updated all test files to use these utilities
- Wrapped all async operations properly

## Files Modified

### Core Setup Files
1. **`jest.setup.js`**
   - Enhanced Zustand mock with proper middleware support
   - Improved NetInfo mock with state management
   - Fixed global timer functions
   - Added syncManager mock

2. **`src/test-utils/test-act-utils.ts`** (new)
   - Created utilities for proper act() wrapping
   - Added helpers for async testing

### Test Files Updated
1. **`src/context/__tests__/OfflineContext.test.tsx`**
   - Removed local NetInfo mock
   - Used global mock with state triggers
   - Wrapped all async operations in actAsync
   - Added proper wait times for initialization

2. **`src/stores/__tests__/bouncePlanStore.test.ts`**
   - Used actAsync for all state updates
   - Added proper waits for persistence
   - Fixed rehydration tests

### Mock Files Created
1. **`src/services/database/sync/__mocks__/syncManager.ts`**
   - Mock implementation of syncManager
   - Prevents dynamic import issues

## Testing Strategy

### Verification Steps
1. Run individual test suites to verify each fix
2. Check for specific error messages
3. Verify no act warnings
4. Ensure all tests pass

### Test Script
Created `test-blockers-fix-verification.sh` to:
- Test each blocker fix individually
- Run full test suite for affected files
- Generate coverage report

## Best Practices Applied

### 1. **Centralized Mocking**
- All mocks defined in `jest.setup.js`
- Consistent behavior across all tests
- Easy to maintain and update

### 2. **Act Wrapper Utilities**
- Reusable utilities for async operations
- Consistent pattern across tests
- Prevents act warnings

### 3. **Mock State Management**
- Mocks maintain state for realistic testing
- Helpers to trigger state changes
- Reset functions for test isolation

### 4. **Type Safety**
- TypeScript types maintained in test utilities
- Proper casting for mocked modules
- Type-safe test helpers

## Next Steps

1. **Run Verification**:
   ```bash
   ./test-blockers-fix-verification.sh
   ```

2. **Apply Pattern to Other Tests**:
   - Use the act utilities in other test files
   - Apply the same mocking patterns
   - Ensure consistency across the test suite

3. **Monitor for Regressions**:
   - Watch for reappearance of act warnings
   - Ensure mocks stay in sync with real implementations
   - Update mocks when APIs change

## Conclusion

The fixes address all identified blockers:
- ✅ Zustand store initialization works with persist middleware
- ✅ Dynamic imports handled with proper mocking
- ✅ Global timer functions available in all contexts
- ✅ Network state changes properly simulated
- ✅ Act warnings eliminated with proper wrappers

The test suite should now run without the identified errors, providing a stable foundation for TDD development.
