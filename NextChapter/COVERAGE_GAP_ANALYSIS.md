- Development-only components, can skip

### 3. Already High Coverage (Polish to 100%)
- **components/feature/resume/** - 98.68% coverage
- **services/resume/** - 91.32% coverage
- **utils/budget/** - 100% coverage âœ…
- Just need 1-2 edge cases each

## Prioritized Action Plan

### Phase 1: Safety Critical (Week 1)
1. **NotificationSetup.tsx** - Crisis notifications
2. **CoachSettings.tsx** - Emotional tone safety
3. **MoodSelector.tsx** - Mental health tracking
4. **Navigation** - Core app functionality
**Expected Coverage Gain: +8%**

### Phase 2: Core Features (Week 2)
1. **Job Tracker Components** - Main user flow
2. **Onboarding Screens** - User retention
3. **Database Services** - Data integrity
**Expected Coverage Gain: +10%**

### Phase 3: Polish (Week 3)
1. **Sync Components** - Offline reliability
2. **Budget edge cases** - Financial accuracy
3. **High coverage files to 100%**
**Expected Coverage Gain: +7%**

## Effort Calculation

### To Reach 80% Coverage:
- **Total Lines Needed**: ~2,051 lines
- **Files Needing Tests**: 47 files
- **Critical Files**: 15 files
- **Estimated Time**: 3 weeks (1 developer)

### Coverage Distribution Target:
- Safety Critical: 95%+ coverage
- Core Features: 85%+ coverage
- UI Components: 80%+ coverage
- Utils/Helpers: 70%+ coverage
- Config/Types: Skip or minimal

## Test Implementation Strategy

### 1. Use Existing Patterns
```typescript
// All tests should follow established patterns:
- Mock stores with createMockStore()
- Mock navigation with mockNavigation
- Use test builders for data
- Include accessibility tests
- Test error states
```

### 2. Focus on User Impact
- Crisis detection accuracy
- Financial calculation precision
- Emotional tone appropriateness
- Offline data integrity

### 3. Skip These Files
- Type definitions (*.d.ts)
- Style files (*.styles.ts) 
- Constants (unless complex logic)
- Dev-only components

## Monitoring Progress

### Weekly Targets:
- Week 1: 54% â†’ 62% (+8%)
- Week 2: 62% â†’ 72% (+10%)
- Week 3: 72% â†’ 80% (+8%)

### Daily Progress:
- 3-4 components per day
- ~250-300 lines of tests per day
- Run coverage after each component
