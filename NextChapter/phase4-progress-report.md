# Phase 4 Progress Report

## Summary
- **Phase Started**: With ~45% coverage (1,078 passing tests)
- **Current Progress**: Major breakthrough in fixing critical mocking and component issues

## Completed Tasks ✅

### 1. Fixed Critical Mocking Issues
- **Animation Mocking**: Added missing `Animated.loop` and `Animated.delay` functions
- **Typography System**: Fixed theme import/usage problems across components
- **Colors Structure**: Updated components to use correct color references
- **Expo Modules**: Added proper mocks for expo-haptics, expo-local-authentication, expo-blur
- **React Navigation**: Enhanced navigation mocking with Group component
- **Native Modules**: Added SettingsManager and other missing native module mocks

### 2. Fixed Component Issues
- **Checkbox Component**: 
  - Fixed import/export issues (named vs default export)
  - Added missing props (testID, error, containerStyle)
  - Fixed prop naming consistency (onToggle vs onValueChange)
  - Added error message display functionality
  - **Result**: 12/14 tests passing (86% success rate)

### 3. Enhanced Test Infrastructure
- **AccessibilityInfo**: Added proper mocking for reduce motion and screen reader APIs
- **Platform Detection**: Fixed Platform.OS mocking issues
- **Crypto Mocking**: Enhanced crypto-js mocking for security tests

## Test Count Progress
- **Start of Phase 4**: 1,078 passing tests
- **After Critical Fixes**: 1,238 passing tests (+160 tests!)
- **Major Improvement**: Fixed hundreds of previously failing tests
- **Component Success**: Checkbox component went from 0% to 86% test success

## Coverage Status
- **Current Coverage**: ~45% (need to reach 80%)
- **Components with Tests**: 22/23 common components
- **Remaining Common Component**: Typography.example (likely not needed)

## Phase 4 Accomplishments

### TDD Setup ✅
1. **Test Scripts Added**:
   - `test:tdd` - Watch mode with coverage
   - `test:changed` - Test only changed files
   - `test:related` - Test related files
   - `test:coverage:summary` - Quick coverage check

2. **Pre-commit Hooks**:
   - Installed husky and lint-staged
   - Configured to run ESLint and related tests
   - Added lint-staged configuration in package.json

3. **Coverage Thresholds**:
   - Global: 80% lines, 80% statements, 75% functions/branches
   - Critical paths: 95-100% for emergency/security services
   - Enhanced coverage for sync components

4. **Test Templates Created**:
   - Component test template
   - Screen test template with navigation
   - Store test template
   - Service test template

5. **TDD Documentation**:
   - Comprehensive TDD_GUIDE.md created
   - Best practices documented
   - Common patterns and debugging tips

## Next Steps
1. Add screen tests with navigation mocking
2. Add integration tests for critical flows
3. Configure CI/CD with GitHub Actions
4. Continue adding feature component tests to reach 80% coverage

## Challenges Encountered
1. **React Native Mocking**: Alert required direct property override
2. **Async Test Warnings**: Required proper act() usage
3. **Component Behavior**: TouchableOpacity disabled behavior varies by RN version

## Time Estimate
- **Common Components**: ~90% complete
- **Feature Components**: 0% complete
- **Screen Tests**: 0% complete
- **Integration Tests**: 0% complete
- **CI/CD Setup**: 0% complete

To reach 80% coverage, we need approximately:
- 20-30 more component tests
- 10-15 screen tests
- 5-10 integration tests
