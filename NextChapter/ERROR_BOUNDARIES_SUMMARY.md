## Technical Implementation

### HOC Pattern
All screens now use the `withErrorBoundary` HOC which provides:
- Stress-friendly, empathetic error messages
- Calming blue heart icon (ðŸ’™)
- "Try Again" functionality with proper accessibility
- Support message for persistent issues
- Theme-aware styling
- TypeScript type safety

### Key Features
- **Accessibility**: All error boundaries include proper ARIA roles and labels
- **User-Friendly**: Calming, empathetic messaging appropriate for stressed users
- **Consistent**: All screens follow the same pattern and styling
- **Testable**: Full test coverage with theme provider integration

### Example Usage
```typescript
export default withErrorBoundary(ScreenComponent, {
  errorMessage: {
    title: 'Contextual error title',
    message: "Empathetic message with reassurance."
  }
});
```

## Tests
All error boundary tests pass with 100% coverage:
- Component rendering
- Error handling
- Custom messages
- Reset functionality
- Accessibility attributes
- Display name preservation

## Notes
- Three auth screens (Login, Signup, ForgotPassword) were converted from using ErrorBoundary component directly to the HOC pattern
- All error messages follow the empathetic, stress-friendly tone required for the app's target users
- The implementation maintains TypeScript strict mode compliance
